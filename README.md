# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Portfolio Optimisation

This project demonstrates how to use the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** to estimate the expected returns and risks for a portfolio of assets. 
The estimates are then used in a **Quadratic Programming** approach to optimise the portfolio for maximum return at a given risk level.

## Features

* Estimate expected asset returns using CAPM
* Calculate portfolio risk and return
* Optimise asset allocation using quadratic programming

## Installation

Before running the notebook, install the required package:

```bash
pip install yfinance
